## What's the point?
- Virtual machines changed the way we can use computers. Before the idea of VMs, you could only use one [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) on a computer. ALthough VMs are not used as much today, they allow those who are interested in learning the opportunity to use other operating systems on their computer, that way you do not have to have two seperate computers to have linux and windows, for example.
