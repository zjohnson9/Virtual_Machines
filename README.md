## Who should read this?
- If you are getting into a technology major or minor, or just have an interest in [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) this is for you. If you have never heard of Virtual Machines (VMs) this is a good starting point.

## What's the point?
- Virtual machines changed the way we can use computers. Before the idea of VMs, you could only use one [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) on a computer. Although VMs are not used as much today, they allow those who are interested in learning the opportunity to use other operating systems on their computer, that way you do not have to have two seperate computers to have [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), for example.
